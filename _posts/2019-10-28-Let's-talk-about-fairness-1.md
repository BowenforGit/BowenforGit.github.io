This series of posts is a summary of fairness issues in machine learning. Fairness is a wide subject to study, spanning various disciplines including computer science, social science, law etc. My posts mainly focus on the different definitions for fairness and algorithms to achieve the fairness in machine learning models. As a huge number of fairness measurements emerged recent years, I will mainly talk about the significant ones, e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, counterfactual fairness.
