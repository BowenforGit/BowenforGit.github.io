<br>
<br>
I was admitted to CUHK in 2016 as a general engineering student and later I chose to study Computer Science in 2017. I have taken a wide range of classes in computer science and mathematics, covering various topics in systems, algorithms, optimizations etc. After graduation, I intend to apply for a master's program in order to prepare me better for future PhD study or pursuing a career in industry.

I love hiking and gym work. I visited most mountains in Hong Kong and a few in Switzerland, famous and less-known, mild and wild.
